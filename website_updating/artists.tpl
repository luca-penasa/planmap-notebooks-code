    <div>The PLANMAP outreach program based on drawings is carried out by the
      UNIPD members and sustained by professional artists and the editors of the
      PLANCK journal. The program will envisage up to 24 illustrations
      subdivided on the bases of the different scopes and audiences: 9
      illustrations are dedicated to kids, 9 of them will constitute a Comics
      series telling planetary geological mapping during the project
      development; finally 6 of them, that go under the name of Drawing the
      Future, will be used to populate the web-site and will depict how
      planetary exploration will be in the near future also thanks to PLANMAP
      products. Most of them will be delivered also as flyers on whose reverse
      side will appear sentences recalling the PLANMAP project activities.</div>
